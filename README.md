## Description

I made a web application that simulates or tries to reproduce a section of Reviews in the form of Slider where each review will show a photo, a name, a role and a description. It will also have an automatic slide in case the user does not use the buttons, and a manual slide in case the user wants to use the next or prev buttons.

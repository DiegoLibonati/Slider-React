# Slider React

## Educational Purpose

This project was created primarily for **educational and learning purposes**.  
While it is well-structured and could technically be used in production, it is **not intended for commercialization**.  
The main goal is to explore and demonstrate best practices, patterns, and technologies in software development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Join to the correct path of the clone
3. Execute: `yarn install` or `npm install`
4. Execute: `yarn run dev` or `npm run dev` and enjoy!

## Description

I made a web application that simulates or tries to reproduce a section of Reviews in the form of Slider where each review will show a photo, a name, a role and a description. It will also have an automatic slide in case the user does not use the buttons, and a manual slide in case the user wants to use the next or prev buttons.

## Technologies used

1. React JS
2. Typescript
3. CSS3
4. Vite
